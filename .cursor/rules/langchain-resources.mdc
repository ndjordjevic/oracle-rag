# LangChain/LangGraph Resource Access

**ALWAYS** use these MCP servers for LangChain/LangGraph documentation and code examples:

1. **`user-docs-langchain`** (primary) - Use `SearchDocsByLangChain` for LangChain-specific queries
2. **`user-context7`** (fallback) - Use `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` for general library docs or when docs-langchain doesn't have what you need

## Reference Projects

Use these example projects for valid LangChain/LangGraph patterns with the newest API:
- `/Users/nenaddjordjevic/PythonProjects/langchain-academy/`
- `/Users/nenaddjordjevic/PythonProjects/lca-lc-foundations/`
- `/Users/nenaddjordjevic/PythonProjects/lca-langchainV1-essentials/`
- `/Users/nenaddjordjevic/PythonProjects/lca-langgraph-essentials/`

## Guidelines

- Prefer `user-docs-langchain` for LangChain-specific queries
- Use `user-context7` as fallback or for related libraries
- Check MCP servers BEFORE making assumptions about LangChain APIs
- Use specific queries (avoid vague searches)

## When Answering Questions

- **Always cite sources**: Always cite the source documentation you're referencing, including URLs when available
- **Search priority**: First search the listed documentation resources above. If information is not found there, you may search the internet
- **Internet search citation**: When using information from internet searches, you must list the specific resources (URLs, websites, articles) where you found the information
- **Strictly avoid hallucinations**: Never make up or guess information
- **Be honest about uncertainty**: If information cannot be found in the available documentation resources or through internet search, explicitly state \"I don't know\" or \"I cannot find this information\" rather than speculating or inventing details
- **Verification**: Only provide information that can be verified from the listed documentation sources, workspace codebase, or cited internet resources
